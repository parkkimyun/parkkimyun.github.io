"A guy, sitting in [SFO](https://www.flysfo.com/) [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal), dives into a Wendy's burger - his budget-friendly feast. Around him, the world buzzes with travelers knowing exactly where they're headed. He, on the other hand, is just hoping the burger will give him some direction... or at least some comfort while he figures out his next move!"

Actually, this guy turns out to be one of the co-founders of [AegisData.AI]({{'/'}}). :)
